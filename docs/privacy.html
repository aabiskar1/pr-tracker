        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>GitHub Personal Access Token:</strong> We require your
                GitHub token to access the GitHub API and fetch pull request
                data. This token is encrypted and stored locally on your device.
                It is never transmitted to any third-party servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User-created Password:</strong> The password you create
                to encrypt your token is stored temporarily in memory if you
                choose the "Remember password" option. It is not stored
                persistently.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. <strong>User Preferences</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We store your preferences, such as dark/light mode settings,
                filter configurations, and notification settings, locally on
                your device.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. <strong>Pull Request Data</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                PR Tracker fetches data about your GitHub pull requests,
                including titles, repository names, reviewer information, and
                status data. This data is cached locally to improve performance.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            The information collected is used solely to provide the core
            functionality of the PR Tracker extension, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fetching and displaying your GitHub pull requests</li>
            <li>Providing status updates, filtering, and sorting options</li>
            <li>Sending notifications for new PR assignments or updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data, including your GitHub
                token and preferences, is stored locally on your device. We do
                not transmit or store your data on external servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Encryption:</strong> Your GitHub token is encrypted
                using the password you create. This ensures that your token
                remains secure and inaccessible without your password.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            PR Tracker does not share your data with any third-party services.
            The extension communicates directly with the GitHub API to fetch
            pull request data.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Token Management:</strong> You can revoke your GitHub
                token at any time from your GitHub account settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Resetting the Extension:</strong> If you forget your
                password or wish to reset the extension, you can use the "Reset
                App" option to clear all stored data.
            </li>
        </ul>
