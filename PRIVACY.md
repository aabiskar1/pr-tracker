# Privacy Policy for PR Tracker

Effective Date: April 21, 2025

## Introduction

Thank you for using PR Tracker! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our browser extension.

## Information We Collect

PR Tracker collects and processes the following types of information:

### 1. **Authentication Information**
- **GitHub Personal Access Token**: We require your GitHub token to access the GitHub API and fetch pull request data. This token is encrypted and stored locally on your device. It is never transmitted to any third-party servers.
- **User-created Password**: The password you create to encrypt your token is stored temporarily in memory if you choose the "Remember password" option. It is not stored persistently.

### 2. **User Preferences**
- We store your preferences, such as dark/light mode settings, filter configurations, and notification settings, locally on your device.

### 3. **Pull Request Data**
- PR Tracker fetches data about your GitHub pull requests, including titles, repository names, reviewer information, and status data. This data is cached locally to improve performance.

## How We Use Your Information

The information collected is used solely to provide the core functionality of the PR Tracker extension, including:
- Fetching and displaying your GitHub pull requests
- Providing status updates, filtering, and sorting options
- Sending notifications for new PR assignments or updates

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: All data, including your GitHub token and preferences, is stored locally on your device. We do not transmit or store your data on external servers.
- **Encryption**: Your GitHub token is encrypted using the password you create. This ensures that your token remains secure and inaccessible without your password.

## Third-Party Services

PR Tracker does not share your data with any third-party services. The extension communicates directly with the GitHub API to fetch pull request data.

## Your Choices

- **Token Management**: You can revoke your GitHub token at any time from your GitHub account settings.
- **Resetting the Extension**: If you forget your password or wish to reset the extension, you can use the "Reset App" option to clear all stored data.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Effective Date" will be updated accordingly.
